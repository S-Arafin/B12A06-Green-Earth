Question-1

var Has function scope, can be declared again and updated.

let Has block scope, can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.

const Also block scoped, cannot be re-declared or reassigned, but objects and arrays can still have their contents changed.

Question-2

forEach() Runs a function on each element but does not return a new array.

map() Applies a function to each element and gives back a new array of the same size.

filter() Returns a new array containing only the elements that match a condition.

Question-3

Arrow functions in ES6 provide a shorter way to write functions. They donâ€™t have their own this, arguments, or new, which makes them perfect for callbacks and concise coding.

Question-4

Destructuring in ES6 is a way to pull out values from arrays or objects and store them directly into variables.

Question-5

Template literals in ES6, written with backticks (`), let you insert variables with ${} and create multi-line strings, making them more flexible than using + for string concatenation.
